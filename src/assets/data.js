      "‘I want to introduce you to Natasha and for you to ‘hear’ her voice through my words. Where to begin? Natasha was many things and when I think of her an ocean of adjectives flood my thoughts. I hope Natasha will forgive me if I miss any adjectives that she would have me include if she was editing this! So here goes. Tasha was bubbly, had the loudest laugh ever, fun, bright, courageous, loving, talented, generous, loved animals but rabbits and puppies the most! She was also feisty, outspoken, fiercely loyal to family and friends, impatient to get things done in the shortest time possible and was like a machine in the gym!",
    para2:
      "I want to tell you about her wicked sense of humour and how proud we were of Natasha when she realised her dream of becoming a journalist and working for the BBC. I want to tell you the funny stories of her childhood.. but that would take too long and this is not the place!",
    para3:
      "I don’t want to tell you that our gorgeous, adored daughter ended her own life in March 2020. The pain of even writing that sentence, let alone saying it out loud, is heart breaking beyond words. Yet I have to because Natasha has left us with her ‘voice’ and thoughts as her legacy and we want her to be heard. We believe that she would want us to do this.",
    para4:
      "As a BBC journalist working on Instagram Stories Natasha’s passion and drive was to try to find a platform for those who needed their voices to be heard; the people who might otherwise be overlooked Natasha often said,",
    para5:
      "So here’s the plan: There are 2 main strands to Natasha’s Voice. The first is to raise and provide funds to make an annual award to a student graduating from the University of Worcester with a degree in media studies. The award is given to a student who has demonstrated outstanding talent in broadcast journalism. The second strand is to develop and donate resources to programmes addressing mental anguish, predominantly, but not exclusively, experienced by young people.",
